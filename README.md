# BasicEngine

The 'BasicEngine' started as a tool to teach friends the basic inner workings of games.
Written from the ground up with just the tools and api's java 7 provided, it grew into a small/basic usable framework for 2d games/apps.

## Features:
- Double-buffered 2D rendering
- Keyboard and Mouse input
- Audio-playback of 'wav' files
- Basic window-management
- small custom GUI!
